Factors That Determine The Price Of Loose Diamonds
Dataset contains information on 53940 diamonds. According to some characteristics we will predict the cost.

1.Carat Weight

Carat size has the biggest impact on the price of loose diamonds. This may be the first question you ask yourself when trying to determine how much money you want to spend on the diamond.

2.Cut

Cut refers to how the facets and angles of a diamond work together to reflect light. Cut has the single biggest impact on the sparkle, brightness and the beauty of a diamond. A well cut diamond is desirable and valuable when it has that distinctive and tremendous light return, aka sparkle and fire.

3.Color

Color refers to how white, or "colorless," the diamond appears. The better the color, the more rare and more expensive that diamond will be.

4.Clarity

Clarity is a measure of how many imperfections are in the diamond, like dark spots, gas bubbles, white spots, cracks, or cloudiness. The cleaner a diamond is (the less imperfections), the rarer it is and the more it will cost even if the imperfections are barely visible to the naked eye.

5.Shape

A diamond's shape can impact that price of a loose diamond.

6.Table Width

If the table (upper flat facet) is too large then light will not play off of any of the crown's angles or facets and will not create the sparkly rainbow colors that are so beautiful in diamonds because it will all simply escape from the top center. If it is too small then the light will get trapped and that attention grabbing shaft of light will never come out but will “leak” from other places in the diamond.

7.Depth

If a diamond's depth percentage is too large or small the diamond will become dark in appearance because it will no longer return an attractive amount of light.

Why the problem need to be solved


The price of the diamond is hard to figure for normal buyer as it depends on many factors you can see two diamonds with ths same weight(carat) but stil very diffferent on price scale . " Take a look at this diamond from Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072L343M2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thediamondpro-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B072L343M2&linkId=b169c65833f9b1074b4c82cb125f7e58 and then take a look this diamond from Blue Nile. https://www.bluenile.com/diamond-details/LD09889381?click_id=962062758 They’re both one carat diamonds. Does it make sense that they’re the same size, yet one costs 1,179 and the other 16,500? To make it even crazier, the Blue Nile diamond may actually be a better value!"
